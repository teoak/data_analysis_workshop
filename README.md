# data_analysis_workshop

Many tools are available for data analysis and presentation, but a few stand out as they lay the ground for industry standards. 
Instant Finance Partners' Data Analysis Workshop works with SQL, Excel and Power BI to demonstrate their power in action. 
The workshop starts with a basic sales database and applies the primary features of all 3 tools to gain insights from data and present their results. 

The Lead Merchants Database was created to work with the reporting and analysis software. 
In this workshop, the 2019 sales database of Lead Merchants is analysed; the 2020 database follows.

Lead Merchants is a global online retailer that sells products in around 160 countries. 
Their sales database, a set of 5 tables, consists of 2 million lines of sales data realised in 2019.
